    <div class="post-content"><p>What kind of a person am I ?</p>
<p>It has always been habitual to wrap up in disguise in front of others, not wanting them to see that bad self. These disguises, layer upon layer, to the point that now, even I can not recognize myself.</p>
<p>The actual fact is that you can find a lot of people who are not able to get the best out of the company. The same is true of the students around you, but they don&rsquo;t seem to be as depressed as I am, or perhaps everyone is used to hiding it.</p>
<p>This is the first time that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what I really want, and whether I&rsquo;m really lost. I failed my exams and was at a loss. As a guy, standing at this crossroads, how to take the next step.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for a long time, and I realized that I&rsquo;m not confused. At least now, I know exactly what I want to do in the next few years. Even if I didn&rsquo;t get into my preferred field of study, it didn&rsquo;t really make me feel miserable. I think what I&rsquo;m really missing is the bond. 21 is the right age. In the future, as a half-finished adult, as time passes, I want to make a success in the work I love, which is my own recognition of myself.</p>
<p>I have to consider the bondage from my family, the bondage from my friends and family, the bondage from the people I care about, and in the end, I still care so much about what others see.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just as well that Mom and Dad are so supportive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m like a person who is always tired of running around, most of the time with my head up and looking ahead. For example, when I fell in love in middle school, I was looking forward to growing up and getting married, and being able to live an ordinary life with her; then I was looking forward to going to a good university for the college entrance exam, and I was looking forward to the envious eyes of others at that time; when I was a sophomore, I was looking forward to working for Ali after graduation and getting a high salary; when I was studying, I was looking forward to following a good mentor and learning formal verification.</p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t seem to pay much attention to the immediate future.</p>
<p>When I think of a certain winter vacation, my ex-girlfriend said to me, she said you don&rsquo;t need to be very successful in order to accompany me properly to do better things.</p>
<p>Put the good in tomorrow&rsquo;s tomorrow.</p>
<p>This may also be a kind of escape.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to write down&hellip; These days do a good job at this stage of things.</p>
